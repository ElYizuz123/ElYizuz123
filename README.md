# Hi, my name is José de Jesús 👋
**Full-stack web & Android developer**

I'm a Systems Engineering Student at Instituto tecnológico de Morelia. I have always been attracted to technology, so I decided to start studying a related career since 2021, and I love all about programming.

I'm a proactive, creative, responsible person who knows how to work on teams and who loves to learn new things about every kind of topic. My life philosophy is that if you can imagine an idea, then you can figure out how to program it.
